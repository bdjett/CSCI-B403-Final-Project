#CSCI-B403 Final Project

Final Project for IU CSCI-B403 (Analysis of Algorithms)

##Course Description

Course focused on algorithm design methodology, general methods for analysis of algorithms, analysis of the specific alogirthm performance (including searching and sorting).

##Project Description

The purpose of this project was to implement an algorithm (Karatsuba multiplication) that multiplies large positive integers very quickly. The running time of the algorithm is then analyzed and compared to the "grade-school" multiplication algorithm that is much slower.
